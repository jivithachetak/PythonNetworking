# PythonNetworking
Networking in Python 

# Task Assigned
Write a python3 script that will test the network connection on your computer (preferably Linux):
1) Check if an ip address is assigned on the network interface
2) Check if the default route/gateway info is provided
3) Ping gateway
4) Check connection to www.heise.de
Apart from raw logs, we are interested in some form of automatic evaluation. Extra points for defining a class with functions for each test.



# Solution Approaches
1) Have written Python program as *.py files.
2) Have written Python program as executed EurofinAssignmemt.ipynb files.
3) Have written in Class and function and executed in eurofinsclass.ipynb
